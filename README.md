# Database_php
this is to explain how to establish a connection between SQL and php

**Step1**
-First we have to create a database with a table, In this we made a database name - "school" and table "class"

-we made 4 col "rollno-AutoIncrement , fname-varchar255 , lname- varchar255, marks"

-then we established a connection with sql by entering the given details.

- As shown in data02, we can also confirm if the value has been added or not by checking the database for new values
