# Database_php
this is to explain how to establish a connection between SQL and php

**Step1**
-First we have to create a database with a table, In this we made a database name - "school" and table "class"

-we made 4 col "rollno-AutoIncrement , fname-varchar255 , lname- varchar255, marks"

-then we established a connection with sql by entering the given details.

**Step2**

- After estabilishing a connection we will then Insert the Value into the database using SQL querries in PHP

- As shown in data02, we can also confirm if the value has been added or not by checking the database for new values

**Step3**

- When we are done Inserting the Values in the table we need to fetch the data and display it

- We will write sql query to select the data and then we will use while loop to display the data in one row

-As shown in data03
